		<h1>Welcome to Grand Slam Goldens</h1>
		<section>
			<p>As a dedicated advocate for the bond between people and their canine companions, I have enjoyed helping many pet parents build skills in their observation, understanding of and behaviors toward their dogs, which leads to happier, safer, and more enjoyable relationships. After all, enjoying life together with your canine family member is what we‚Äôre hoping to achieve!</p>
			<p>More than just ‚Äúdog training,‚Äù I strive to provide each client with the knowledge they need to make life with their dog, whether at home, in public, or in competition venues, as successful and joyful as it has been for me for over 20 years. My dogs, Finn and Dottie, are beloved members of our family, but that doesn‚Äôt always come easy. Not all dogs are the same, and, just like people, all dogs benefit from a personal approach to their unique learning styles. For this reason, I prefer to work with clients 1:1 in training sessions so we can both focus on your success. Occasionally, I offer group classes on specific interests, such as competition skills, fitness foundations etc. As a preferred client, you and your dog will be offered priority access to these classes.</p>

			<h2>Training Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I am considered a <b>balanced trainer</b> and place exceptionally high emphasis on positive reinforcement and providing the dog with the best possible learning environment and opportunities for success.</p>
			<p>I work hard to help you recognize, understand and subsequently reduce the pressures we place on our dogs while focusing on building a solid history of successes. It‚Äôs been my experience that this can be accomplished through helping you ‚Äúsee‚Äù the learning environment and associated challenges through the eyes of your dog.</p>
			<p>I use a variety of tools in my own training, primarily martingale collars, marker cues and the more advanced multiple marker cues to take advantage of the dog‚Äôs own willingness to learn and please.</p>
			<p>In some cases, I have used Herm Springer pinch collars or e-collars. It is important to note that those tools are reserved for specific issues and only used under intense supervision, thoughtful consideration of all other training avenues already explored, the dog himself, the client‚Äôs own goals and unique circumstances, and with the support of certified canine behaviorists.</p>
			<p>I DO NOT require my students to use any method they do not embrace, and I welcome and encourage open and honest communication between student and instructor. There is no bad question in a learning environment. At the end of the day, this is your learning journey and both you and your dog should benefit from every mile traveled.</p>
			<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> I am not a canine behaviorist, but I will do my best to research and help you with any issue we encounter. However, If I do not feel I can adequately address a behavior issue I will work with you to find professionals with more intensive training, certification, and experience. My goal is to provide you with the best opportunity for success possible.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Appointments</h2>
			<p>Appointments are made directly with me. I have a limited number of private sessions available per week, scheduled around my ongoing training goals with my own dogs. All sessions are held at a mutually agreed upon location to facilitate real-life learning in applicable environments (i.e. your home, local park, my home, big box stores that welcome pets, etc.). Sessions are approximately 60 minutes in length, containing both interactive skill building and discussions. Your dog will be allowed critical ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù in every session so that you and I may take time to discuss each session‚Äôs progress and direction.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>The initial consultation is to provide an opportunity to introduce myself, meet and learn about you and your dog, and discuss your goals. It will generally last 45-60 minutes, for which I charge $60. Whether you choose to continue with private sessions or not, I will provide a written follow-up assessment of our meeting/consultation outlining my observations and basic recommendation for training goals. Following that, if we agree to continue with private sessions my rates are $40/hr. Cost for my travel to meet clients beyond a 25-mile radius of my Mansfield home will be discussed as the need arises. I accept Venmo, PayPal, Google Pay, Zelle, and cash.</p>
